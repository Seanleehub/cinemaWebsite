                    <p><strong>Enjoyable, sharply written and smartly directed costume drama with  terrific performances from Knightley and Fiennes and intriguing  not-so-subtle parallels with recent Royal scandals.</strong><br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>What's it all about?</strong><br />
                        Based  on a true story, The Duchess is set in the late 1700s and stars Keira  Knightley as Georgiana Spencer (Princess Diana's  great-great-great-great aunt), who's married off to the wealthy Duke of  Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) while still a teenager. However, Georgiana  soon discovers that the Duke is only interested in acquiring a male  heir and that she's expected to be a mother to his illegitimate  daughter and put up with him sleeping with the servants.<br />
                        <br />
                        As the  years pass, Georgiana gives birth to two daughters but no sons, which  only drives the Duke and Duchess further apart. Things get even worse  when the Duke begins an affair with Georgiana's best friend Bess  (Hayley Atwell) and moves her into their house, while Georgiana herself  is tempted into an affair with her childhood friend Charles Grey  (Dominic Cooper), who's destined to become Prime Minister.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>The Good</strong><br />
                        The  script is superb, subtly drawing out the intriguing parallels between  the lives of Georgiana and Princess Diana – in her day, Georgiana was  also a much talked-about fashion icon who used her status to help  people and was even pursued by the 18th century equivalent of the  paparazzi (i.e. sketch artists). So it's a shame that the film's  posters go and hit you over the head with it, by trumpeting the  tag-line &quot;There were three people in her marriage&quot;.<br />
                        <br />
                        Knightley is  excellent, delivering several stinging lines and putting all her  frock-wearing, lip-quivering skills to good use. In addition, Fiennes  is perfectly cast as the emotionally distant Duke and there's strong  support from Atwell, Cooper and Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's  mother, Lady Spencer.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>The Great</strong><br />
                        Director Saul Dibb  orchestrates some powerfully emotional scenes – the moment when  Georgiana discovers Bess' betrayal is particularly wrenching. The film  also benefits from sumptuous cinematography courtesy of Guyla Pados.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Worth seeing?</strong><br />
                        The Duchess is an emotionally engaging drama with a terrific central performance from Keira Knightley. Recommended.</p>
