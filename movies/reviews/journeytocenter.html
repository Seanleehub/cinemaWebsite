                    <strong>Entertaining fantasy adventure with engaging characters and superb  special effects, but the filmmakers miss several great opportunities  along the way.</strong><br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>What's it all about?</strong><br />
                    While on a  scientific expedition in Iceland, professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan  Fraser), his 13-year-old nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and their  beautiful local guide Hannah (Anita Briem) become trapped in a cave  while investigating seismic readings. Their only escape is to go deeper  into the depths of the Earth, but when they accidentally fall through a  rock floor, they are plunged into a hidden world, hundreds of miles  beneath the surface of the earth, just like in - gasp! - Jules Verne's  Journey to the Centre of the Earth.<br />
                    <br />
                    Indeed, the world turns out  to be exactly as described in Verne's novel and they're soon dodging  man-eating plants, flying piranhas and dinosaurs as they try to find  their way back to the surface.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>The Good</strong><br />
                    The cast are  superb, creating likeable characters that we instantly warm to – Fraser  and Hutcherson spark off each other particularly well and their gradual  bonding is nicely done. Similarly, the underground world is beautifully  designed, while the 3D effects are excellent and provide several good  moments.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>The Bad</strong><br />
                    Unfortunately, the film has clearly  been tailored towards a family audience, so there are very few scary  moments, and no one's ever really in any danger. Similarly, the romance  angle is remarkably chaste and there's an awful moment where Sean gets  a phone call, despite being thousands of miles underground.<br />
                    <br />
                    The  biggest problem is that the 3D effects don't really live up to their  early promise – for example, there's an insect at the beginning whose  3D feelers caused squeals at the child-friendly press screening, so  it's a shame that there's no 3D creepy-crawly attack later on. It also  seems that certain scenes have been cut out – for example, Sean is  shown practising with a yo-yo early on but it's never seen again.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Worth seeing?</strong><br />
                    This  is an entertaining, well acted adventure flick with great special  effects, but it would have been a lot better without its  family-friendly certificate.
