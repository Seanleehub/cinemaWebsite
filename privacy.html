                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered 
                on the ame.com  website operated by Advanced Motion 
                Experience.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully
                before using the Advanced Motion Experiences site.  
                Usage of the Advanced Motion Experiences website is 
                conditional upon you agreeing to be bound  by this 
                privacy policy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>1. Your personal information is important to us</strong><br />
				Advanced Motion Experiences respects the importance of your 
                privacy, and that you have a  right to make your own choices 
                about how your personal information is  collected and used. 
                We know that when you provide personal information  to us you
                are showing your trust and we take that seriously. Unless you
                directly give us consent to do otherwise, Advanced Motion 
                Experience will only collect and  use your personal information 
                as we explain below.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Collecting information about you</strong><br />
                Except as stated in below, Advanced Motion Experiences will not
                collect or monitor any personal information about you without
                your consent:<br /><br />
   
                we collect information when you enter your personal information
                on our  site, for example by joining the AME Movie Club or 
                taking part in a  competition, when we ask for information 
                such as your email address,  name, address, date of birth 
                and what movies you like the most;<br /><br />
        
                if you register on the site, we may also collect information 
                on how you  use the site in order to make it as interesting 
                as possible for you; and<br /><br />
                
                if you contact us, we may also keep a record of that contact.
                We will only collect additional personal information, 
                other than that explained here, with your consent.
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Using and disclosing your personal information.</strong><br />
                Our purpose in collecting information about you is to:<br />
                
                provide you with information which interests you and provide
                you with a  better website experience with information and 
                special offers that are  more relevant to your interests. 
                Advanced Motion Experiences will not use or disclose any  information about you 
                without your consent, unless required by law<br /><br />
                
                we believe it necessary to fulfil the above purposes 
                or otherwise to  provide you with a service which you 
                have requested to implement our  terms and condition to 
                protect the rights, property or personal safety of another 
                Advanced Motion Experiences user, any member of the public or Advanced Motion Experiences.<br /><br />
                
                In seeking to give you the most worthwhile experience of
                our website  possible, Advanced Motion Experiences may use your personal information 
                to send you  advertisements about products and services which 
                we think you are  likely to be interested in. We do not disclose 
                information about you to  advertisers. Instead, advertisers 
                give us advertisements and tell us  the kind of audience they 
                wish to reach. Advanced Motion Experiences then takes the  advertisement and displays 
                it to users who are most likely to have an  interest in the product or service.
                <br /><br />

                In order to operate the website, fulfil the purposes set out above or 
                otherwise deliver a service we may sometimes share your personal 
                information with a service partner or a company connected with Advanced Motion Experience 
                (by, for example, a common  shareholder or some common commercial interest). 
                We will not otherwise  disclose your personal information to other 
                companies without your  explicit consent.
